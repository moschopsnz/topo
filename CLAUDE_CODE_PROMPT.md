# Claude Code Prompt: Topo Gigio's Scrollytelling Adoption Page

## Project Overview

Build a **product-first, story-led single-page website** that tells the story of **Topo Gigio**, a 10-year-old male Standard Grey chinchilla (born 2 December 2015) who is looking for a new forever home. The page should use a **scrollytelling pattern** where scrolling reveals each section in sequence, with **sticky visuals that stay anchored** while the narrative text evolves beside or below them.

## Design Philosophy

This isn't a typical pet listing—it's a premium product page for a living companion. Think Apple product page meets heartfelt animal rescue. The goal is to:

1. **Tell Topo's story** in a way that emotionally connects with potential adopters
2. **Educate** about chinchilla care requirements so only serious adopters inquire
3. **Convert** the right person to submit an expression of interest

## Technical Requirements

### Core Scrollytelling Mechanic

Implement a **scroll-triggered reveal system** where:

- **Hero section** displays Topo's name and tagline with a full-bleed chinchilla portrait
- As the user scrolls, a **sticky image/visual** remains pinned to one side (on desktop) or stays in view (on mobile) while text content scrolls past it
- Each major section has its own anchored visual that transitions smoothly as the user progresses
- Use CSS `position: sticky` or JavaScript-based scroll detection (Intersection Observer) to trigger transitions
- Consider using a library like GSAP ScrollTrigger, Locomotive Scroll, or vanilla JS for scroll-based animations

### Responsive Design

- **Mobile-first**: The primary experience is vertical scrolling with full-width sections
- **Desktop**: Use a split-layout where visuals stick to one side (e.g., left 50%) while content scrolls on the other side
- Breakpoints: 640px (sm), 768px (md), 1024px (lg)

### Tech Stack

- HTML5 + TailwindCSS (via CDN is fine: `https://cdn.tailwindcss.com`)
- Vanilla JavaScript for scroll interactions (or GSAP if preferred)
- Google Fonts: Inter (weights: 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900)
- Material Symbols Outlined for icons
- No framework required—single HTML file is acceptable

### Color Palette

```javascript
{
  "primary": "#ec6d13",        // Warm orange (CTA buttons, accents)
  "background-light": "#f8f7f6", // Off-white page background
  "background-dark": "#221810",  // Dark brown for dark mode
  "text-dark": "#181411",        // Near-black for light mode text
  "text-light": "#f8f7f6",       // Off-white for dark mode text
  "accent-brown": "#897261",     // Muted brown for secondary text
  "surface-light": "#ffffff",    // Card backgrounds
  "surface-dark": "#2d2118"      // Dark mode card backgrounds
}
```

### 2. TIMELINE: Topo Gigio's Story

**Sticky Visual:** Changes with each timeline milestone (photos noted per event)

**Section intro:**
- Title: "Topo Gigio's Story"
- No subtitle needed — the timeline speaks for itself

**Timeline Events:**

1. **2015 — Born**
   - Photos: early litter / baby shots, if available
   - "Topo Gigio was born on 2 December 2015 in Wellington, New Zealand, to experienced chinchilla owners. From the start, he was healthy, alert, and well cared for during his early weeks with his mother."

2. **2016 — A New Home**
   - Photos: first days, early cage setup, small-scale play
   - "On 18 February 2016, Topo moved into his long-term home in Miramar. He was given space, consistency, and time to settle — learning routines, voices, and the rhythms of daily life."
   - "This was also when his name settled naturally: Topo Gigio."

3. **2017–2018 — Learning the World**
   - Photos: playtime, climbing, interaction
   - "As he grew, Topo became confident and exploratory. Rooms were carefully chinchilla-proofed, and supervised free-roaming became part of his normal routine."

### 3. PERSONALITY: Temperament & Communication

**Sticky Visual:** Close-up portrait showing Topo's expressive features; additional photos of interaction moments

---

**Overview:**

> Topo Gigio has a distinct, expressive personality shaped by trust, familiarity, and choice.
>
> He is curious, emotionally aware, and communicative — affectionate on his own terms and confident enough to set boundaries when something doesn't feel right. He is not aggressive or demanding, but he is deeply responsive to people who understand him.

---

**Temperament at a Glance** (visual trait list):

- **Curious & observant** — mirrors human attention and interest
- **Affectionate (self-directed)** — seeks contact when he wants it
- **Cheeky & self-aware** — understands when he's testing limits
- **Sensitive but resilient** — startles easily, recovers quickly
- **Highly communicative** — clear vocal and physical signals
- **Trust-based** — calm and gentle with those he knows

---

**How He Relates to People:**

Topo enjoys human company and is comfortable with close physical presence. He will climb onto shoulders, walk across arms or legs, investigate faces, and gently touch noses — behaviours that indicate trust rather than dependency.

He prefers clear, confident handling. Firm, deliberate strokes feel more reassuring to him than light, uncertain touches, and he settles quickly when he feels physically secure.

**He is particularly fond of:**
- Chin and ear scratches
- Gentle head strokes
- Belly rubs during playtime

*Affection is always initiated by him. Like a cat, he chooses when to engage — and that choice matters.*

---

**Communication & Vocalisation:**

Topo is expressive, though generally quiet.

**He uses:**
- **Soft nibbling** (never biting) as a sign of trust and comfort
- **Short barks or warning sounds** to communicate boundaries or mild annoyance
- **Occasional vocal "singing"** — rare, enthusiastic bursts of sound that appear to be exploratory or playful rather than distress-related

These vocal moments are uncommon (noticed only every few months) and often occur when he seems relaxed and content — as though rediscovering his own voice.

*Understanding these signals is key: what may seem alarming to unfamiliar owners is, in practice, clear and non-aggressive communication.*

---

**Early Attachment & Emotional Awareness:**

From his earliest days, Topo showed a strong capacity for emotional connection.

On his first night away from his mother, he became unsettled and vocalised loudly — settling immediately when held and comforted. Physical closeness and calm voice were enough to reassure him, and he quickly learned that he was safe.

That early need for reassurance has evolved into a secure, confident temperament rather than ongoing anxiety. He is independent, but emotionally aware and responsive.

---

**Sensitivity & Confidence:**

Topo is naturally wary of sudden noises or unfamiliar events, as most chinchillas are. When startled, he will retreat briefly — then return quickly once he understands the situation is safe.

He is notably unfazed by everyday household sounds, including vacuuming and movement, and is confident navigating familiar environments.

---

**Social Suitability:**

Topo is gentle, non-biting, and tolerant, including around calm, supervised children.

**His wellbeing depends on:**
- Respect for his signals
- Secure handling
- An environment that allows him choice and retreat

*He thrives with people who understand chinchilla behaviour and appreciate communication over constant interaction.*

---

### 4. ENVIRONMENT: Ideal Home & Habitat

**Sticky Visual:** Photos of Topo's actual living space, cage setup, free-roaming area

---

**Overview:**

> Topo Gigio thrives in an environment designed around space, safety, and calm.
>
> He has always lived with generous room to move, explore, and rest — both inside and outside his cage — and his wellbeing is closely tied to having a predictable, chinchilla-safe space where he can act naturally without constant restriction.

---

**Space & Freedom:**

Topo is accustomed to significantly more space than is typical for a chinchilla.

Over the years, his usable area has ranged from approximately **8–20 m²**, depending on the home and season. His current setup provides around **8 m² of safe, open floor space**, with his cage positioned within that area rather than acting as his sole enclosure.

**Key principles:**
- His cage door is often left open, allowing him to move in and out freely
- The cage functions as his private, elevated sleeping space
- Free movement is only possible because the room is deliberately chinchilla-proofed

*He prefers sleeping up high, where he can look down on his surroundings — a natural behaviour that has remained consistent throughout his life.*

---

**Flooring & Surfaces:**

Topo has lived primarily on carpeted flooring, which has proven safer for him than loose or peelable materials.

- Carpet reduces the risk of ingestion if chewed
- Edges are kept out of reach where possible
- Solid flooring is preferred over wire or grid floors

**Cage floors are always solid, not mesh.** While mesh floors can be easier to clean, solid surfaces significantly reduce the risk of foot injury and long-term discomfort.

---

**Walls, Barriers & Safety:**

Topo is an active jumper and enjoys bouncing off solid surfaces during play.

**For this reason:**
- Hard walls are safer than cage-style barriers
- Grid or wire fencing poses a risk to feet and limbs
- Any barriers used must be secure, smooth, and escape-resistant

*The guiding rule has always been to reduce injury risk before convenience, especially if he is left alone in the space.*

---

**Enrichment & Objects:**

Topo does not require constant toys, but he values purposeful, familiar items.

**He particularly enjoys:**
- Cardboard tubes (appropriately sized and replaced as he grew)
- Objects he can move, enter, and climb through
- Dedicated chew materials provided both inside and outside his cage

*His environment prioritises open movement over clutter.*

---

**Dust Bath:**

Topo has continuous access to a dust bath in his room.

- Dust is refreshed regularly (approximately weekly)
- Bathing is self-regulated rather than restricted
- He uses it when he feels the need, not on a schedule

*This has been his routine for many years and works well for him.*

---

**Light, Noise & Rest:**

Topo sleeps during the daytime and is accustomed to a quiet, dim environment.

- Blackout blinds are used to reduce daytime light
- His room is kept calm while he rests
- He tolerates household noise when necessary, but his normal routine is quiet

*This mirrors natural chinchilla rhythms and supports good rest.*

---

**Temperature & Climate** (⚠️ Critical):

Temperature control is the **most important environmental requirement**.

Topo has always lived in a carefully managed climate:

| Condition | Range |
|-----------|-------|
| **Ideal range** | ~14–18 °C |
| **Caution zone** | Above ~20 °C |
| **Heat risk** | Genuine health danger — chinchillas cannot sweat |

**Safeguards used:**
- Dehumidifier running continuously
- Active monitoring with temperature sensors
- Alerts when temperatures rise
- Air conditioning used during hot periods when needed

*Warm days require active observation, not passive trust.*

---

**The Ideal Home:**

Topo is best suited to a home that can offer:

- ✓ Prior chinchilla experience
- ✓ A dedicated, chinchilla-proofed space
- ✓ Solid flooring and safe wall surfaces
- ✓ Reliable temperature control
- ✓ Respect for his need for independence and choice

*This section isn't about luxury — it's about continuity.*

### 5. CARE ROUTINE: Daily Rituals

**Sticky Visual:** Soft texture shot of chinchilla fur or daily activity image

**Section intro:**
- Title: "A day in the life of Topo"
- Subtitle: "Consistent care is key to a happy chin. Here is what his daily schedule looks like to ensure he stays healthy and social."

**Daily Schedule (timeline format):**

| Time | Activity | Tags | Description |
|------|----------|------|-------------|
| 7:00 AM | Morning Refresh | Quick, Essential | Top up Timothy hay and check water bottle. Quick visual health check. |
| 6:00 PM | Dinner & Dust | Moderate, Hygiene | 1/4 cup of pellets. 15-minute dust bath to keep his coat clean and oil-free. |
| 8:00 PM | Playtime & Bonding | Social, High Effort | Safe roaming time in a chin-proofed area. This is the best time for bonding. |

**Handling Guide (accordion/expandable):**

1. **The Scoop Method**
   - "Topo feels safest when his feet are supported. Place one hand under his chest and scoop his hind legs with the other."
   - ⚠️ "Always support his weight fully. Do not dangle."

2. **Approach & Trust**
   - "Chinchillas are prey animals. Always approach from the side, never from directly above, which simulates a bird of prey."

3. **⚠️ Critical Warnings** (red-themed)
   - **Never grab the tail:** This can cause a "fur slip" or serious spinal injury.
   - **Ribs are floating:** Squeezing too hard can break them. Gentle hands only.

```

### Scroll Trigger Behavior

1. **Section Entry:** When a section enters the viewport, its associated image fades/slides into the sticky container
2. **Progress Indicator:** Optional subtle progress bar or dot navigation on the side
3. **Smooth Transitions:** Use `opacity`, `transform`, and `clip-path` for image transitions
4. **Performance:** Use `will-change: transform` sparingly, prefer CSS-only solutions where possible

### Example Scroll Implementation (Vanilla JS)

```javascript
const sections = document.querySelectorAll('.story-section');
const stickyImage = document.querySelector('.sticky-image');

const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
  entries.forEach(entry => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      const newImage = entry.target.dataset.image;
      stickyImage.src = newImage;
      stickyImage.classList.add('fade-in');
    }
  });
}, { threshold: 0.5 });

sections.forEach(section => observer.observe(section));
```

---

## Image Assets

Use placeholder images from the example files or source appropriate chinchilla imagery. Key images needed:

1. Hero portrait (full-bleed, high-quality)
2. Baby chinchilla (timeline)
3. Dust bath action shot (timeline)
4. Human interaction shot (timeline)
5. Adult portrait (timeline + personality)
6. Cage/environment setup photos (3+)
7. Texture/fur close-up (care routine)
8. Circular avatar for form section

---

## Final CTA

Every major section should have a secondary way to progress or express interest. The sticky footer or floating action button with "Inquire to Adopt" should be visible after scrolling past the hero section.

---

## Deliverables

1. Single `index.html` file with embedded CSS/JS (or separate files if preferred)
2. Mobile-responsive scrollytelling experience
3. Smooth scroll-triggered image transitions
4. Dark mode support (optional but appreciated)
5. Accessible (proper heading hierarchy, alt text, focus states)

---

## Tone & Voice

- **Warm but sophisticated** – This isn't baby talk; it's appreciating Topo as a unique individual
- **Informative but not clinical** – Care requirements are presented as features, not barriers
- **Gently characterful** – Let Topo's personality shine through observation and detail
- **Honest about commitment** – Even at 10, Topo has years ahead; this is still a significant commitment

---

Build this page to make someone fall in love with Topo Gigio and understand exactly what adopting him means. Good luck!
