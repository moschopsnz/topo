# Claude Code Prompt: Topo's Scrollytelling Adoption Page

## Project Overview

Build a **product-first, story-led single-page website** that tells the story of Topo, a 4-year-old male Standard Grey chinchilla who is looking for a new forever home. The page should use a **scrollytelling pattern** where scrolling reveals each section in sequence, with **sticky visuals that stay anchored** while the narrative text evolves beside or below them.

## Design Philosophy

This isn't a typical pet listing—it's a premium product page for a living companion. Think Apple product page meets heartfelt animal rescue. The goal is to:

1. **Tell Topo's story** in a way that emotionally connects with potential adopters
2. **Educate** about chinchilla care requirements so only serious adopters inquire
3. **Convert** the right person to submit an expression of interest

## Technical Requirements

### Core Scrollytelling Mechanic

Implement a **scroll-triggered reveal system** where:

- **Hero section** displays Topo's name and tagline with a full-bleed chinchilla portrait
- As the user scrolls, a **sticky image/visual** remains pinned to one side (on desktop) or stays in view (on mobile) while text content scrolls past it
- Each major section has its own anchored visual that transitions smoothly as the user progresses
- Use CSS `position: sticky` or JavaScript-based scroll detection (Intersection Observer) to trigger transitions
- Consider using a library like GSAP ScrollTrigger, Locomotive Scroll, or vanilla JS for scroll-based animations

### Responsive Design

- **Mobile-first**: The primary experience is vertical scrolling with full-width sections
- **Desktop**: Use a split-layout where visuals stick to one side (e.g., left 50%) while content scrolls on the other side
- Breakpoints: 640px (sm), 768px (md), 1024px (lg)

### Tech Stack

- HTML5 + TailwindCSS (via CDN is fine: `https://cdn.tailwindcss.com`)
- Vanilla JavaScript for scroll interactions (or GSAP if preferred)
- Google Fonts: Inter (weights: 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900)
- Material Symbols Outlined for icons
- No framework required—single HTML file is acceptable

### Color Palette

```javascript
{
  "primary": "#ec6d13",        // Warm orange (CTA buttons, accents)
  "background-light": "#f8f7f6", // Off-white page background
  "background-dark": "#221810",  // Dark brown for dark mode
  "text-dark": "#181411",        // Near-black for light mode text
  "text-light": "#f8f7f6",       // Off-white for dark mode text
  "accent-brown": "#897261",     // Muted brown for secondary text
  "surface-light": "#ffffff",    // Card backgrounds
  "surface-dark": "#2d2118"      // Dark mode card backgrounds
}
```

- Primary CTA: "Meet Topo" button

**Quick Stats Strip** (after hero):
| Age | Sex | Weight |
|-----|-----|--------|
| 4 Years | Male | 600g |

**Biography:**
> "Topo is a Standard Grey chinchilla with a personality that defies the typical 'rodent' stereotype. He values personal space, structural routine, and high-quality dust baths.
>
> Unlike dogs that demand affection, Topo earns it. He is an observer—watching from his highest ledge, judging your choice of TV show, and occasionally gracing you with a gentle nose boop when the mood strikes him."

### 4. ENVIRONMENT: Habitat Requirements

**Sticky Visual:** Multi-level cage setup or environmental shots

**Section intro:**
- Title: "The Ideal Habitat"
- Subtitle: "A chinchilla's environment is the key to their longevity. Topo needs a cool, spacious sanctuary to thrive physically and mentally."

**Critical Stats:**
| Requirement | Value | Note |
|-------------|-------|------|
| Temperature | 60-70°F | 🔴 Critical Requirement |
| Cage Height | 4ft+ | Minimum Vertical Space |

**Housing Essentials:**
1. **Chin Spin Wheel** – Must be at least 15" diameter to protect their spine. Metal or wood only.
2. **Wooden Ledges** – Staggered placement to encourage jumping. Kiln-dried pine is safest.
3. **Hiding Spots** – Fleece hammocks or wooden houses for daytime sleeping privacy.

**Material Safety Guide** (two-column):

### 5. CARE ROUTINE: Daily Rituals

**Sticky Visual:** Soft texture shot of chinchilla fur or daily activity image

**Section intro:**
- Title: "A day in the life of Topo"
- Subtitle: "Consistent care is key to a happy chin. Here is what his daily schedule looks like to ensure he stays healthy and social."

**Daily Schedule (timeline format):**

| Time | Activity | Tags | Description |
|------|----------|------|-------------|
| 7:00 AM | Morning Refresh | Quick, Essential | Top up Timothy hay and check water bottle. Quick visual health check. |
| 6:00 PM | Dinner & Dust | Moderate, Hygiene | 1/4 cup of pellets. 15-minute dust bath to keep his coat clean and oil-free. |
| 8:00 PM | Playtime & Bonding | Social, High Effort | Safe roaming time in a chin-proofed area. This is the best time for bonding. |

**Handling Guide (accordion/expandable):**

1. **The Scoop Method**
   - "Topo feels safest when his feet are supported. Place one hand under his chest and scoop his hind legs with the other."
   - ⚠️ "Always support his weight fully. Do not dangle."

2. **Approach & Trust**
   - "Chinchillas are prey animals. Always approach from the side, never from directly above, which simulates a bird of prey."

3. **⚠️ Critical Warnings** (red-themed)
   - **Never grab the tail:** This can cause a "fur slip" or serious spinal injury.
   - **Ribs are floating:** Squeezing too hard can break them. Gentle hands only.

```

### Scroll Trigger Behavior

1. **Section Entry:** When a section enters the viewport, its associated image fades/slides into the sticky container
2. **Progress Indicator:** Optional subtle progress bar or dot navigation on the side
3. **Smooth Transitions:** Use `opacity`, `transform`, and `clip-path` for image transitions
4. **Performance:** Use `will-change: transform` sparingly, prefer CSS-only solutions where possible

### Example Scroll Implementation (Vanilla JS)

```javascript
const sections = document.querySelectorAll('.story-section');
const stickyImage = document.querySelector('.sticky-image');

const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
  entries.forEach(entry => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      const newImage = entry.target.dataset.image;
      stickyImage.src = newImage;
      stickyImage.classList.add('fade-in');
    }
  });
}, { threshold: 0.5 });

sections.forEach(section => observer.observe(section));
```

## Image Assets

Use placeholder images from the example files or source appropriate chinchilla imagery. Key images needed:

1. Hero portrait (full-bleed, high-quality)
2. Baby chinchilla (timeline)
3. Dust bath action shot (timeline)
4. Human interaction shot (timeline)
5. Adult portrait (timeline + personality)
6. Cage/environment setup photos (3+)
7. Texture/fur close-up (care routine)
8. Circular avatar for form section

---

## Final CTA

Every major section should have a secondary way to progress or express interest. The sticky footer or floating action button with "Inquire to Adopt" should be visible after scrolling past the hero section.

---

## Deliverables

1. Single `index.html` file with embedded CSS/JS (or separate files if preferred)
2. Mobile-responsive scrollytelling experience
3. Smooth scroll-triggered image transitions
4. Dark mode support (optional but appreciated)
5. Accessible (proper heading hierarchy, alt text, focus states)

---

## Tone & Voice

- **Warm but sophisticated** – This isn't baby talk; it's appreciating Topo as a unique individual
- **Informative but not clinical** – Care requirements are presented as features, not barriers
- **Gently humorous** – "judging your choice of TV show" energy
- **Honest about commitment** – 15-20 year lifespan is prominently mentioned

---

Build this page to make someone fall in love with Topo and understand exactly what adopting him means. Good luck! 🐭
