            <div class="content-block" data-sticky-image="personality.interaction">
                <h3>How He Relates to People</h3>
                <p>Topo enjoys human company and is comfortable with close physical presence. He will climb onto shoulders, walk across arms or legs, investigate faces, and gently touch noses — behaviours that indicate trust rather than dependency.</p>
                <p>He prefers clear, confident handling. Firm, deliberate strokes feel more reassuring to him than light, uncertain touches, and he settles quickly when he feels physically secure.</p>

                <h4>He is particularly fond of:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chin and ear scratches</li>
                    <li>Gentle head strokes</li>
                    <li>Belly rubs during playtime</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="italic text-accent-brown mt-4">Affection is always initiated by him. Like a cat, he chooses when to engage — and that choice matters.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Communication & Vocalisation -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Communication & Vocalisation</h3>
                <p>Topo is expressive, though generally quiet.</p>

                <h4>He uses:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Soft nibbling</strong> (never biting) as a sign of trust and comfort</li>
                    <li><strong>Short barks or warning sounds</strong> to communicate boundaries or mild annoyance</li>
                    <li><strong>Occasional vocal "singing"</strong> — rare, enthusiastic bursts of sound that appear to be exploratory or playful rather than distress-related</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These vocal moments are uncommon (noticed only every few months) and often occur when he seems relaxed and content — as though rediscovering his own voice.</p>

                <p class="italic text-accent-brown mt-4">Understanding these signals is key: what may seem alarming to unfamiliar owners is, in practice, clear and non-aggressive communication.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Early Attachment & Emotional Awareness -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Early Attachment & Emotional Awareness</h3>
                <p>From his earliest days, Topo showed a strong capacity for emotional connection.</p>
                <p>On his first night away from his mother, he became unsettled and vocalised loudly — settling immediately when held and comforted. Physical closeness and calm voice were enough to reassure him, and he quickly learned that he was safe.</p>
                <p>That early need for reassurance has evolved into a secure, confident temperament rather than ongoing anxiety. He is independent, but emotionally aware and responsive.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Sensitivity & Confidence -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Sensitivity & Confidence</h3>
                <p>Topo is naturally wary of sudden noises or unfamiliar events, as most chinchillas are. When startled, he will retreat briefly — then return quickly once he understands the situation is safe.</p>
                <p>He is notably unfazed by everyday household sounds, including vacuuming and movement, and is confident navigating familiar environments.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Social Suitability -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Social Suitability</h3>
                <p>Topo is gentle, non-biting, and tolerant, including around calm, supervised children.</p>

                <h4>His wellbeing depends on:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Respect for his signals</li>
                    <li>Secure handling</li>
                    <li>An environment that allows him choice and retreat</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="italic text-accent-brown mt-4">He thrives with people who understand chinchilla behaviour and appreciate communication over constant interaction.</p>

            <!-- Overview -->
            <div class="quote-block">
                <p>Topo Gigio thrives in an environment designed around space, safety, and calm.</p>
                <p>He has always lived with generous room to move, explore, and rest — both inside and outside his cage — and his wellbeing is closely tied to having a predictable, chinchilla-safe space where he can act naturally without constant restriction.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Space & Freedom -->
            <div class="content-block" data-sticky-image="environment.room">
                <h3>Space & Freedom</h3>
                <p>Topo is accustomed to significantly more space than is typical for a chinchilla.</p>
                <p>Over the years, his usable area has ranged from approximately <strong>8–20 m²</strong>, depending on the home and season. His current setup provides around <strong>8 m² of safe, open floor space</strong>, with his cage positioned within that area rather than acting as his sole enclosure.</p>

                <h4>Key principles:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>His cage door is often left open, allowing him to move in and out freely</li>
                    <li>The cage functions as his private, elevated sleeping space</li>
                    <li>Free movement is only possible because the room is deliberately chinchilla-proofed</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="italic text-accent-brown mt-4">He prefers sleeping up high, where he can look down on his surroundings — a natural behaviour that has remained consistent throughout his life.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Flooring & Surfaces -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Flooring & Surfaces</h3>
                <p>Topo has lived primarily on carpeted flooring, which has proven safer for him than loose or peelable materials.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Carpet reduces the risk of ingestion if chewed</li>
                    <li>Edges are kept out of reach where possible</li>
                    <li>Solid flooring is preferred over wire or grid floors</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Cage floors are always solid, not mesh.</strong> While mesh floors can be easier to clean, solid surfaces significantly reduce the risk of foot injury and long-term discomfort.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Walls, Barriers & Safety -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Walls, Barriers & Safety</h3>
                <p>Topo is an active jumper and enjoys bouncing off solid surfaces during play.</p>

                <h4>For this reason:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hard walls are safer than cage-style barriers</li>
                    <li>Grid or wire fencing poses a risk to feet and limbs</li>
                    <li>Any barriers used must be secure, smooth, and escape-resistant</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="italic text-accent-brown mt-4">The guiding rule has always been to reduce injury risk before convenience, especially if he is left alone in the space.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Enrichment & Objects -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Enrichment & Objects</h3>
                <p>Topo does not require constant toys, but he values purposeful, familiar items.</p>

                <h4>He particularly enjoys:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cardboard tubes (appropriately sized and replaced as he grew)</li>
                    <li>Objects he can move, enter, and climb through</li>
                    <li>Dedicated chew materials provided both inside and outside his cage</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="italic text-accent-brown mt-4">His environment prioritises open movement over clutter.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Dust Bath -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Dust Bath</h3>
                <p>Topo has continuous access to a dust bath in his room.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dust is refreshed regularly (approximately weekly)</li>
                    <li>Bathing is self-regulated rather than restricted</li>
                    <li>He uses it when he feels the need, not on a schedule</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="italic text-accent-brown mt-4">This has been his routine for many years and works well for him.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Light, Noise & Rest -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Light, Noise & Rest</h3>
                <p>Topo sleeps during the daytime and is accustomed to a quiet, dim environment.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Blackout blinds are used to reduce daytime light</li>
                    <li>His room is kept calm while he rests</li>
                    <li>He tolerates household noise when necessary, but his normal routine is quiet</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Treats: Used Sparingly, With Intention</h3>
                <p>Topo Gigio does not receive routine treats.</p>
                <p>Because his daily diet already includes a wide variety of high-quality foods, he naturally treats some of his regular items — particularly whole oats — as rewards in their own right. This helps maintain healthy eating habits and prevents selective feeding.</p>
                <p class="italic text-accent-brown">Sweet foods are intentionally limited.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-6">Why Treats Are Restricted:</h4>
                <p>Like many chinchillas, Topo has a clear preference for sweet foods. If offered too frequently, he will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Begin ignoring his regular meals</li>
                    <li>Hold out for sweet items</li>
                    <li>Disrupt his digestive balance</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Rather than negotiating with this behaviour, treats are managed carefully and predictably.</p>
                <p class="italic text-accent-brown mt-4">If sweet foods are reduced or removed entirely, he reliably returns to normal eating within a few days. Consistency matters more than indulgence.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-6">When Treats Are Given:</h4>
                <p>Treats are reserved for specific, infrequent occasions, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Birthdays or seasonal events (e.g. Christmas)</li>
                    <li>Reuniting after time away</li>
                    <li>Calm introductions to new people</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In social settings, treats serve a practical purpose: helping wake him gently during daytime rest, allowing visitors to interact positively, and enabling safe, gentle hand-feeding experiences.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-6">Preferred Treat: Goji Berries</h4>
                <p>When treats are offered, <strong>goji berries</strong> are used exclusively.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lower moisture content than raisins or cranberries</li>
                    <li>Less stickiness on fur and hands</li>
                    <li>Easy for him to hold and eat</li>
                    <li>Longer shelf life when refrigerated</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Goji berries are stored separately (in the fridge) to reduce temptation, reinforce that treats are not part of daily feeding, and maintain clear boundaries in routine.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Guiding Principle -->
            <div class="quote-block">
                <p><strong>Guiding Principle:</strong> Treats are never used to compensate for routine, boredom, or guilt.</p>
                <p>Topo's long-term health has benefited from controlled sweetness, predictable meals, clear limits, and consistent care.</p>
                <p>This approach keeps him engaged, healthy, and content — without dependency or dietary conflict.</p>

            <div class="quote-block">
                <p>Topo Gigio does best with a predictable rhythm: quiet daytime rest, followed by a consistent evening routine that includes fresh food, a clean environment, and calm social time.</p>
                <p>Routine is not about rigidity. It's about giving him a stable pattern he can rely on, so he can choose interaction confidently and rest without interruption.</p>

            <!-- Daily Rhythm -->
            <div class="content-block" data-sticky-image="care.routine">
                <h3>Daily Rhythm</h3>

                <h4>Daytime (Rest)</h4>
                <p>Topo generally sleeps during the day. He may occasionally wake briefly for a drink or a short run, but his room is set up to support daytime rest:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Low light (blackout blinds)</li>
                    <li>Reduced noise where practical</li>
                    <li>Minimal disruption unless necessary</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="italic text-accent-brown">If visitors arrive during the day, he can be gently roused if needed, but his normal routine prioritises sleep.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-6">Evening Wake-up (~7pm)</h4>
                <p>Around 7pm, Topo's day begins. This is the "good morning" check-in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open the upper cage door (if closed overnight)</li>
                    <li>Quick water check</li>
                    <li>Open curtains / adjust airflow (weather-dependent)</li>
                    <li>Calm greeting and a little conversation</li>
                    <li>Gentle head / chin scratches if he wants them</li>
                    <li>Room door left open so he can hear and observe the household</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="italic text-accent-brown">This moment sets the tone: calm, familiar, and unhurried.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-6">Late Evening Care & Play (10pm–11pm)</h4>
                <p>Between 10pm and 11pm (sometimes a little later), the main care routine happens:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cage clean (as needed)</li>
                    <li>Water refreshed</li>
                    <li>Food replenished</li>
                    <li>Hay topped up</li>
                    <li>Bedding changed</li>
                    <li>Quick visual health check</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After cleaning, Topo usually has his main social/play time: free movement in his chinchilla-proofed room, calm interaction, talking, and gentle affection on his terms. Extra time on weekends or Fridays when available.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-6">Overnight</h4>
                <p>Topo is active overnight. His door is often closed mainly for sound isolation (e.g., wheel running), and to keep the household routine consistent.</p>
                <p>A simple verbal "check" helps avoid mistakes before leaving him for the night: Water ✓ Food ✓ Hay ✓</p>
                <p class="italic text-accent-brown">This reduces the chance of a missed refill, especially in warm weather.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Where He Spends Time -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Where He Spends Time</h3>
                <p>Topo mostly stays in his own dedicated room. This is deliberate:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The room is chinchilla-proofed</li>
                    <li>It's safe for chewing behaviour</li>
                    <li>It avoids household hazards (wires, plastics, furniture damage, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="italic text-accent-brown">Occasionally, he'll be carried for a brief "tour" of the house while being held securely — a way to satisfy curiosity without exposing him to risk.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Handling & Safety -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Handling & Safety</h3>
                <p>Topo is a delicate animal. Safe handling is built around two principles:</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
                    <li><strong>Security</strong> — he must feel stable and supported</li>
                    <li><strong>Gentleness</strong> — firm enough to prevent falls, never squeezing</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="italic text-accent-brown">He responds best to calm voice and confident movement. Silence and hesitation can make him uncertain.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-6">How He Likes to Be Held</h4>
                <p>Topo is not typically a "pick-me-up" chinchilla anymore.</p>
                <p>When younger, he was more willing to hop onto hands. Around age 4–5, he became more selective about being picked up.</p>
                <p>If he is picked up: He needs a solid base under his feet. He will adjust his hind feet to find balance. Once stable, he settles and becomes calm.</p>
                <p class="italic text-accent-brown">He should never be carried in a way that encourages jumping down from height.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-6">Shoes, Feet, and Movement</h4>
                <p>When in his play space:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shoes are avoided where possible</li>
                    <li>Slow steps and constant awareness are essential</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Chinchillas can sit very close to feet unexpectedly, and their bones are brittle. Socks/bare feet reduce risk and increase awareness.</p>
                <p class="italic text-accent-brown">Shoelaces and shoe soles are also highly attractive chew targets.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Communication & Boundaries -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Communication & Boundaries</h3>

                <h4>"Mouth as a tool" (not biting)</h4>
                <p>Topo uses his front teeth as a way to move things, explore, or communicate.</p>
                <p>A common example is feeding time: He may try to gently push or pull a hand away to reach the bowl. This can look alarming to unfamiliar handlers, but it is not aggression. He does not pierce skin and does not "bite" in the conventional sense.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-6">When He's Not Happy</h4>
                <p>Topo communicates displeasure clearly and quickly:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A bark/grunt-like warning sound</li>
                    <li>A sharp, visible "don't do that" motion</li>
                    <li>Short-lived irritation if boundaries are repeatedly ignored</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>He particularly dislikes tail handling</strong> (including accidental contact). If that happens, the right response is simple: back off, give him space, allow a few minutes to reset.</p>
                <p class="italic text-accent-brown">He typically returns to normal quickly once respected.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Play Behaviour & Chewing -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Play Behaviour & Chewing</h3>
                <p>Topo loves chewing and will always investigate anything protruding, loose, or textured — especially:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clothing tags and labels</li>
                    <li>Belt leather and belt ends</li>
                    <li>Jeans patches (e.g. leather logo patches)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is normal chinchilla behaviour. It's best managed by wearing "Topo-safe" clothes during play time, removing dangling labels, and keeping tempting items out of reach where possible.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Water (Bowl Only) - Critical -->
            <div class="critical-block">

                    <span class="material-symbols-outlined">warning</span>
                    <span>CRITICAL: Water (Bowl Only)</span>
                </div>
                <p>Topo has always used a water bowl, not a bottle.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>He has never reliably taken to a water bottle</li>
                    <li>Fresh water is provided daily</li>
                    <li>Bowls are cleaned and refilled as part of his nightly routine</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-4">Because hydration is critical, introducing a bottle after ten years is not recommended. A familiar bowl ensures immediate access, predictable drinking behaviour, and no risk of dehydration due to unfamiliar equipment.</p>
                <p class="mt-4 font-medium">Any future home should continue using a water bowl. This is a non-negotiable safety preference, not a convenience choice.</p>

                <h3>Sleeping & Resting Spots</h3>
                <p>Topo sleeps almost exclusively inside his enclosed house, positioned at the top of his cage.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The space is shaded and secure</li>
                    <li>It has a soft, fabric-style base (hammock-like)</li>
                    <li>An external ledge allows him to rest with partial visibility if he chooses</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Approximately 90% of the time, he sleeps inside this house.</strong></p>
                <p>Occasionally, he may nap on a ledge, but his default preference is enclosed, elevated rest.</p>

                <p><strong>Practical Summary:</strong> Topo thrives when his evenings follow a predictable rhythm, his space is safe enough for free movement, handling is confident and supportive, his boundaries are respected, and he is allowed to initiate affection.</p>
                <p>Routine + trust = a calm, bonded chinchilla.</p>

            <div class="quote-block">
                <p>Topo Gigio is not being rehomed casually.</p>
                <p>This expression of interest exists to ensure that any future home can offer the continuity, safety, and quality of life he has always known.</p>
                <p>There is no single "perfect" background — but there is a shared set of values that matters.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- What Matters Most -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>What Matters Most</h3>
                <p>The most important consideration is <strong>confidence</strong> — confidence that Topo's daily care, environment, and long-term wellbeing can continue without compromise.</p>
                <p>That confidence may come from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prior chinchilla experience, or</li>
                    <li>A willingness to learn, follow guidance, and prepare properly</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="italic text-accent-brown mt-4">Experience alone is not enough. Care philosophy matters.</p>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Environment & Lifestyle Expectations</h3>
                <p>Topo is accustomed to:</p>

                        <span>A predictable daily routine</span>

                </ul>
                <p class="mt-4"><strong>He is not a cage-only chinchilla.</strong></p>
                <p class="italic text-accent-brown">Homes where he would need to remain enclosed full-time are unlikely to be suitable.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Other Pets -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Other Pets</h3>
                <p>Topo is a small, delicate animal.</p>
                <p>Homes with dogs, cats, or other animals with prey instincts are <strong>generally not suitable</strong>, particularly because Topo requires supervised freedom outside his cage.</p>
                <p class="italic text-accent-brown mt-4">Safety and calm are non-negotiable.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Time, Commitment & Cost -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Time, Commitment & Cost</h3>
                <p>Topo's care is consistent rather than demanding — but it is not zero-effort.</p>
                <p>Prospective homes should be comfortable with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Daily food, water, hay, and bedding changes</li>
                    <li>Sourcing quality food (including organic dried plants)</li>
                    <li>Occasional higher upfront costs for supplies</li>
                    <li>Long-term commitment (Topo may live another 10 years)</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="italic text-accent-brown mt-4">Rehoming again in the future is something this process aims to avoid.</p>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>Location & Transition</h3>
                <p>Topo is currently based in <strong>Wellington</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Local homes are logistically simpler</li>
                    <li>Longer-distance relocation would require additional planning</li>
                    <li>A careful, supported transition is preferred</li>

                <h3>Keeping His Name</h3>
                <p>Topo Gigio has responded to his name for nearly ten years.</p>
